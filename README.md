## Overview
Clicky-Game is a memory game. The object of the game is to select a character only once. If you fail, you must start over. 


#### -Game-

At the beginning of the game you start with 0 points. Here you simply select a character

If it is a character you have not chosen previously you will see a message which reflects that as well as an uptick in your current count.

On your next pick you will see your current score increase. Additionally if that score is now higher than any previous high score you've gotten it will increase the best score amount as well

If you choose a character twice you will see a new message and your current score will reset to zero. Your highscore stays as is though so you can see what number you need to beat the next time you play.

If you manage to get all of them correct you will get a message letting you know how awesome you are and the game will reset.
